# Photo Hearts Setup

To personalize your Valentine Quiz with your own photos, add 5 images to this directory:

## Required Images:

1. `photo1.jpg` - Will appear in top-left heart
2. `photo2.jpg` - Will appear in top-right heart
3. `photo3.jpg` - Will appear in middle-left heart
4. `photo4.jpg` - Will appear in middle-right heart
5. `photo5.jpg` - Will appear in bottom-center heart

## Image Guidelines:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or any web-compatible image format
- **Size**: Recommended 300x300px or larger (will be cropped to fit heart shape)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square images work best
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB each for fast loading

## How Images Display:

- Images are automatically cropped to fit inside heart-shaped frames
- The hearts gently float up and down with a romantic animation
- Hearts are fixed on the page and visible throughout the quiz
- On hover, hearts slightly enlarge for a nice interactive effect

## Fallback:

If images are not found, placeholder hearts with numbers (1-5) will display instead.

## Example:

```

    photo2.jpg  ← Your second special memory
    photo3.jpg  ← Your third special memory
    photo4.jpg  ← Your fourth special memory
    photo5.jpg  ← Your fifth special memory
```
